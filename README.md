# Minimum-Exact-Cover-Problem and Quantum Algorithms

This repository contains two main directories, **ECP_c-and-q** and **MECP_with-QAOA**, dedicated to solving the Exact Cover Problem and Minimum Exact Cover Problem using classical and quantum computing approaches.

## Directory Structure

### üìÅ **MECP_with-QAOA**
This directory is dedicated to:
1. Implementing the **QAOA+ (Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz)** on Qiskit to solve the Minimum Exact Cover Problem (MECP).
2. Solving the Minimum Exact Cover Problem on fixed instances using QAOA+.

This directory contains a üìú **README.md** file that provides an overview of the contents.

### üìÅ **ECP_c-and-q**
This directory focuses on:
1. **Solving random instances** of the Exact Cover Problem (ECP) and Minimum Exact Cover Problem (MECP) using classical strategies (c).
2. **Solving fixed instances** of the Exact Cover Problem using the D-Wave quantum annealer (q).

## üìñ Accessing Function Documentation with `help()`
Using `help()` is useful when you're working with unfamiliar functions or libraries. To access the documentation of a function `my_function` , simply call:
```
help(my_function)
```
This will display the docstring of `my_function`, which will typically contain:

- A description of what the function does.
- The parameters the function accepts, including their types and default values.
- The return values of the function.
- Any additional notes on how the function should be used.
