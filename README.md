# Minimum-Exact-Cover-Problem and Quantum Algorithms

This repository contains two main directories, **ECP_c-and-q** and **MECP_with-QAOA**, dedicated to solving the Exact Cover Problem and Minimum Exact Cover Problem using classical and quantum computing approaches.

## Directory Structure

### **ECP_c-and-q**
This directory focuses on:
1. **Solving random instances** of the Exact Cover Problem (ECP) and Minimum Exact Cover Problem (MECP) using classical strategies (c).
2. **Solving fixed instances** of the Exact Cover Problem using the D-Wave quantum annealer (q).

### **MECP_with-QAOA**
This directory is dedicated to:
1. Implementing the **QAOA+ (Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz)** on Qiskit to solve the Minimum Exact Cover Problem (MECP).
2. Solving the Minimum Exact Cover Problem on fixed instances using QAOA+.


## 📚 Accessing `.ipynb` Files with JupyterLab

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) files that you can open and modify using **JupyterLab**. Follow the instructions below to set up your environment and access the files.
