# Solving the Minimum-Exact-Cover-Problem (MECP) with Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA+)

This repository contains several notebooks and scripts for solving the Minimum-Exact-Cover-Problem (MECP) using the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA+) and visualizing the results.

## Notebooks Overview

1. **QAOA_k**  
   This notebook is dedicated to the **calculation and visualization of "k" ratios** for different dimensions, instances, and L values. It helps analyze the relationship between `k` and the other parameters across multiple instances.

2. **QAOA_random_parameters**  
   This notebook is focused on **solving the MECP using the "Random Parameters" technique** in the context of QAOA+. The notebook generates output files related to the solution obtained.

3. **QAOA_parameter_fixing**  
   This notebook is focused on **solving the MECP using the "Parameter Fixing" technique** in the context of QAOA+. It generates output files related to the solution obtained.

## Output Folders

Running the `QAOA_random_parameters` or `QAOA_parameter_fixing` notebooks will produce folders named in the following format:

<technique_name>_<current_datetime>

These folders contain the output files generated by running the respective techniques. The output data can then be analyzed and processed further.

## Reading Output Files

To read the output files generated by the QAOA notebooks, follow these steps:

1. **Run the "Read Files" section** in either the `QAOA_random_parameters` or `QAOA_parameters_fixing` notebook.
2. This section will load the output data and prepare it for analysis and visualization.

Alternatively, if you do not wish to run the QAOA notebooks, you can open the output files directly by running the "Import Modules" and "Read Files" sections. This allows you to load and analyze previously generated data without running the optimization process again.


## Conclusion

This repository provides a flexible framework for experimenting with different QAOA techniques and analyzing the results. The notebooks enable you to test two approaches for solving the MECP and easily visualize the corresponding outcomes.

Feel free to explore the notebooks and run the techniques as needed, or load pre-generated data for analysis.
