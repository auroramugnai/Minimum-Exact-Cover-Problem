## 🛠️ Accessing `.ipynb` Files with Jupyter Notebook

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) files that you can open and modify using **Jupyter Notebook**. Follow the instructions below to set up your environment and access the files.

If you don't have **Jupyter Notebook** installed, run the following command in your terminal to install it:
```
pip install jupyter notebook
```
Then, 🚀 launch Jupyter Notebook by running:
```
jupyter notebook
```
This will open your default browser with the Jupyter Notebook interface. If it doesn't, copy and paste the link provided in the terminal into your browser's address bar.

To 📂 open the `.ipynb` files in the Jupyter Notebook interface, use the file browser to navigate to the repository directory. Click on a `.ipynb` file to open it and start working.

## 📚 Notebooks Overview

1. `QAOA_k.ipynb` 
   This notebook is dedicated to the **calculation and visualization of "k" ratios** for different dimensions, instances, and L values. It helps analyze the relationship between `k` and the other parameters across multiple instances.

2. 🎲`QAOA_random_parameters.ipynb` 
   This notebook is focused on **solving the MECP using the "Random Parameters" technique** in the context of QAOA+. The notebook generates output files related to the solution obtained.

3. 🔒`QAOA_parameter_fixing.ipynb` 
   This notebook is focused on **solving the MECP using the "Parameter Fixing" technique** in the context of QAOA+. It generates output files related to the solution obtained.

## 📁 Output Folders

Running the 🎲`QAOA_random_parameters` or 🔒`QAOA_parameter_fixing` notebooks will produce folders named in the following format:

<technique_name>_<current_datetime>

These folders contain the output files generated by running the respective techniques. The output data can then be analyzed and processed further.

## 📄 Reading Output Files

To read the output files generated by the QAOA notebooks, follow these steps:

1. **Run the "Read Files" section** in either the 🎲`QAOA_random_parameters` or 🔒`QAOA_parameters_fixing` notebook. This section will load the **output data generated during the current run**, preparing it for analysis and visualization.

2. Alternatively, if you do not wish to run the entire QAOA notebook, you can **open previously generated output files** by simply running the "Import Modules" and "Read Files" sections. This allows you to load and analyze data from **earlier runs** without needing to rerun the optimization process.


## 🎯 Conclusion

This repository provides a flexible framework for experimenting with different QAOA techniques and analyzing the results. The notebooks enable you to test two approaches for solving the MECP and easily visualize the corresponding outcomes.

Feel free to explore the notebooks and run the techniques as needed, or load pre-generated data for analysis.
