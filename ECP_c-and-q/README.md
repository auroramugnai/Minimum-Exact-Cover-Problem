# Classical and Quantum Solvers for EC and MEC Problems üîçüíª

This repository contains Python code for solving EC (Exact Cover) and MEC (Minimum Exact Cover) problems, both using classical and quantum methods. The project includes several scripts that can generate random instances of these problems, solve them, and process the results. Below is a description of the key files in the repository. 

---
## Files Overview üìÇ

### 1. `random_EC_classical_solver.py` üé≤
This script allows you to generate random instances of the **Exact Cover (EC)** problem and solve them using a classical solver. It provides functionality to create problem instances and find solutions efficiently.

### 2. `random_MEC_classical_solver.py` üé≤
Similar to `random_EC_classical_solver.py`, this script generates random instances of the **Minimum Exact Cover (MEC)** problem and solves them using classical methods.

### 3. `EC_DWave.py` üßë‚Äçüíª‚ö°
In this file, the **EC problem** is solved using quantum computing on the D-Wave platform. It utilizes instances defined in `instances.py`, solves them, and shows the results. Additionally, it saves output files in folders named using the current date and time (e.g., `<datetime>`).

### 4. `EC_DWave_postprocess.py` üßêüìä
This script processes the results generated by `EC_DWave.py`. It reads the files saved in date-named folders (e.g., `<datetime>`) and performs post-processing on the solutions to analyze and interpret the output.

### 5. `utils.py` üîß
The `utils.py` file contains several utility functions that are helpful across the scripts. These functions are designed to assist with tasks like data manipulation, file handling, and other common operations needed in the EC and MEC problem-solving workflows.

## How to Use üìù

1. **Generate and solve EC/MEC problems**:
   - Run `random_EC_classical_solver.py` to generate and solve random instances of the EC problem.
   - Run `random_MEC_classical_solver.py` to generate and solve random instances of the MEC problem.

2. **Solve EC problem for fixed instances with D-Wave**:
   - Ensure you have the necessary credentials for D-Wave.
   - Run `EC_DWave.py` to solve an EC problem using the quantum computing capabilities of D-Wave, using instances from `instances.py`.

3. **Post-process D-Wave results**:
   - After running `EC_DWave.py`, use `EC_DWave_postprocess.py` to read and analyze the results saved in `<datetime>` folders.

4. **Use helper functions**:
   - Check `utils.py` for utility functions that can help you with various tasks throughout the project.

## Setting Up D-Wave LEAP Environment üåê

To use the D-Wave quantum solver, you need to set up the **D-Wave LEAP** environment, which provides access to D-Wave's quantum computers. Here's how to do it:

### Step 1: Create a D-Wave Account
1. Go to [D-Wave LEAP](https://www.dwavesys.com/take-leap) and sign up for a free account if you don't already have one.
2. After signing up, you'll be able to access your **API token**, which is required for connecting to the D-Wave system.

### Step 2: Install the D-Wave Ocean SDK
The D-Wave Ocean SDK provides the necessary tools to work with quantum solvers. Install it using the following command:

```
pip install dwave-ocean-sdk
```

### Step 3: Configure Your API Token
Once you've installed the Ocean SDK, you need to configure your API token. Use the following command to set up the token:
```
dwave config
```
Then you will have to use your API Tooken.

### Step 4: Verify the Setup
To verify that the setup is correct, run the following command to check your connection to D-Wave:
```
dwave ping
```
If everything is set up correctly, you should see a success message.

### Step 5: Run EC_DWave.py
Now that you have D-Wave set up, you can run the EC_DWave.py script to solve the EC problem using D-Wave's quantum computer.
